The robot guards itself against collisions

Overview
This project implements the Potential Fields method for real-time obstacle avoidance on a differential drive robot equipped with a LiDAR sensor, using ROS2 Foxy. The robot navigates toward a specified goal while avoiding obstacles by computing attractive forces (toward the goal) and repulsive forces (from obstacles) based on LiDAR data. The implementation is designed for simulation in Gazebo.
Objectives

Enable safe and efficient navigation by dynamically avoiding obstacles in real-time using LiDAR data.
Demonstrate robust integration with ROS2 middleware for seamless communication and control in a simulated environment.
Provide a practical example of applying the classical Potential Fields algorithm for robotic path planning.

Implemented Functions
The core functionality is implemented in scripts/example.py:

Potential Fields Algorithm: Implemented in the compute_potential_field method . It calculates attractive forces toward the goal  and repulsive forces from obstacles , combining them to determine the robot's velocity.
ROS2 Python Node: Implemented in the PotentialFieldNode class . The node subscribes to /scan (LiDAR), /odom (odometry), and /goal_pose (goal position), and publishes to /cmd_vel .
Differential Drive Kinematics: Implemented in the compute_potential_field and smooth_velocity methods (lines 58–87 and 52–57 in example.py). These translate forces into linear and angular velocities, applying smoothing to ensure stable control of the differential drive robot.

Features

Potential Fields Algorithm: Guides the robot using attractive and repulsive forces.
ROS2 Python Node: Manages communication with ROS2 topics for real-time control.
Differential Drive Kinematics: Ensures precise velocity commands for a differential drive robot.
Code Quality:
Adheres to SOLID, DRY, KISS, and YAGNI principles.
Uses Observer (ROS2 publish-subscribe) and Strategy design patterns.
Includes comprehensive comments and docstrings.

Setup Instructions
Prerequisites

Environment: Ubuntu 20.04 with ROS2 Foxy installed.
Dependencies: rclpy, geometry_msgs, nav_msgs, sensor_msgs, numpy, ros2launch.
Required: Gazebo for simulation.

Using Docker

Follow the instructions in the ROS2 Obstacle Avoidance Docker Setup to launch a container with ROS2 Foxy and dependencies.
Copy the project into the container:mkdir -p ~/problem/src
cp -r solution ~/problem/src/solution



Manual Setup

Create a ROS2 workspace:mkdir -p ~/problem/src
cd ~/problem/src


Copy the solution package into ~/problem/src/solution.
Install dependencies:sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-rosdep python3-colcon-common-extensions
rosdep update
cd ~/problem
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y



Building the Project

Source ROS2:source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash


Build the workspace:cd ~/problem
colcon build
source install/setup.bash


Verify the executable:ls ~/problem/install/solution/lib/solution

Expected Output: example

Running the Example

Launch the map in Gazebo:ros2 launch solution start.launch.py

This starts Gazebo and the potential_field_node.
Alternatively, run the node directly:ros2 run solution example



Examples of Work

Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance: Demonstrated in Gazebo simulations, with the robot navigating around obstacles toward a goal.
Logs and Outputs: Available in the terminal when running ros2 run solution example or in the project repository.
Visual Demonstrations: Screenshots and videos in the project repository show navigation performance.

Submit:
Upload solution.zip to the course portal (e.g., Canvas, Blackboard, or specified platform).
If required, email solution.zip and README.md to the professor with a note explaining the late submission:
Dear Professor, I apologize for the late submission due to technical difficulties with the ROS2 build process in WSL2. The project is complete, with all files in solution.zip and documentation in README.md. Thank you for your consideration.


If physical submission is required, provide a USB drive with solution.zip and README.md.
Confirm submission receipt with the professor or teaching assistant if possible.


Late Submission Note: The project was delayed due to WSL2 build issues, but all functionality has been tested, and the submission includes complete documentation and code.

Troubleshooting

sometime you will get errors so you must try again (see the path , the entire code , make restart for (ex. wsl2)...etc.
some examples of the errors i had .

Missing Executable: If example is not in ~/problem/install/solution/lib/solution:mkdir -p ~/problem/install/solution/lib/solution
cp ~/problem/src/solution/scripts/example.py ~/problem/install/solution/lib/solution/example
chmod +x ~/problem/install/solution/lib/solution/example
ls ~/problem/install/solution/lib/solution

Expected Output: example
Build Errors: Ensure dependencies are installed and ROS2 is sourced:source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash


WSL2 Issues: Verify Python 3.8 and update setuptools:pip3 install --upgrade setuptools
